# Share plugin

A Flutter plugin to share content from your Flutter app via the platform's
share dialog.

Wraps the ACTION_SEND Intent on Android and UIActivityViewController
on iOS.

## Platform Support

| Android | iOS | MacOS | Web | Linux | Windows |
| :-----: | :-: | :---: | :-: | :---: | :----: |
|   ✔️    | ✔️  |  ✔️   | ✔️  |  ✔️   |   ✔️   |

Also compatible with Windows and Linux by using "mailto" to share text via Email.

Sharing files is not supported on Windows and Linux.

## Usage

To use this plugin, add `share_plus` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://plus.fluttercommunity.dev/docs/overview).

## Example

Import the library.

```dart
import 'package:share_plus/share_plus.dart';
```

Then invoke the static `share` method anywhere in your Dart code.

```dart
Share.share('check out my website https://example.com');
```

The `share` method also takes an optional `subject` that will be used when
sharing to email.

```dart
Share.share('check out my website https://example.com', subject: 'Look what I made!');
```

To share one or multiple files invoke the static `shareFiles` method anywhere in your Dart code. Optionally you can also pass in `text` and `subject`.

```dart
Share.shareFiles(['${directory.path}/image.jpg'], text: 'Great picture');
Share.shareFiles(['${directory.path}/image1.jpg', '${directory.path}/image2.jpg']);
```

## Known Issues

### Mobile platforms (Android and iOS)

Due to restrictions set up by Facebook this plugin isn't capable of sharing data reliably to Facebook related apps on Android and iOS. This includes eg. sharing text to the Facebook Messenger. If you require this functionality please check the native Facebook Sharing SDK ([https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing)) or search for other Flutter plugins implementing this SDK. More information can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/plus_plugins/issues/413).


**Important:** As of January 2021, the Flutter team is no longer accepting non-critical PRs for the original set of plugins in `flutter/plugins`, and instead they should be submitted in this project.
